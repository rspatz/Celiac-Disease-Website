<h2>Restaurants</h2>

<p>In my opinion, restaurants are fraught with peril, although many books on Celiac Disease insist that you 
can eat safely, and have a good experience. One recent issue of a magazine on the gluten-free lifestyle 
states that you can take your gluten-sensitive children to a restaurant- just have their medication handy 
in case they have a reaction. Personally, my idea of a pleasant and relaxing evening out does not include 
having medication available, in case someone's throat begins to close up from exposure to wheat! However, 
I do agree that it is everyone's right to go out to a restaurant. Again, you need to be proactive: Read 
the menu, ask the staff what ingredients are used in the recipe, also ask about cross-contamination. The 
kitchen needs to be kept scrupulously clean, and utensils, food preparation counters, and cookware need
to be kept separate from those used for everyone else's food. Some restaurants are unable to guarantee this,
in which case they are not a safe place to eat.

The person with Celiac Disease needs to be polite, but insistent about their safety. Sometimes, the staff
think that the patron is just being picky, and are not very tactful about expressing this opinion.
If you have the disease, do not allow yourself to be ridiculed or made to feel overly fussy. Many people
ecome very nervous about lawsuits when a patron mentions an "allergy", so stating that you have an allergy
to these ingredients will quite often ensure that the staff pays better attention. Celiac Disease is not
technically an allergy but, when your safety is at stake, this may not be the time to be concerned
about accuracy. My mother and I have spoken to several people with Celiac Disease and, when we ask them
if they go out to eat, they respond, "Not usually." Some feel that the only place they can control
what they eat is at home. They also feel that their food tastes better than most restaurants, so they would
rather eat at home anyway.</p>
