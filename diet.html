<h2>The Celiac Diet</h2>

<h3>When a person is diagnosed with Celiac Disease, they must make dramatic changes in the way they maintain good health- One of the major changes involves their diet. Everything a person consumes, whether eaten or applied to their skin, must be gluten-free and, unless a dramatic cure is found, this attitude must remain for life. What many people don't realize is that the food they consume must also be free of cross-contamination.</h3>
    
<h3>Sometimes a food, such as hard candies, is gluten-free, but is manufactured in the same facilities as products containing gluten. In the case of the hard candies mentioned previously, they may not contain any gluten ingredients, but the manufacturer may put wheat flour on the belts the candies are placed on before they are packaged, in order to keep the candies from sticking to the belts. In that case, the candies are no longer gluten-free or safe to consume for someone with the disease.</h3>

<h3>Another thing many people don't realize is that manufacturers have many names for gluten, and that many foods contain wheat and, thus, gluten. This leads to the next major changes a person with Celiac Disease must make to his or her life: that of habits and attitudes.</h3>
    
<h3>These people must be proactive and protective of their bodies. They need to become aware of what they are eating by reading food labels one ingredient at a time, reading allergen statements on cans and packages of food, reading menus at restaurants and asking questions of the staff, refusing gluten-based foods that are offered to them, and educating friends, family, and colleagues. These habits are addressed in more detail in the sections that follow.</h3>

<h2>Being Proactive</h2>

<h3>If you have Celiac Disease, the unfortunate fact is that you are responsible for your own health and safety. When shopping, you must read every ingredient on the label, and learn which ingredients are safe and which contain gluten. You also must read allergen statements- This has all been mentioned above, but it can never be repeated too many times. You also must read the label thoroughly each time you purchase the item, as manufacturers constantly change their recipes without warning.</h3>
    
<h3>Just because an item is safe this time, doesn't mean that it will be safe the next time you purchase it. If in doubt, you will need to call the manufacturer's consumer hotline phone number. Many of these numbers can be found on the product's package, but sometimes you will have to go to the web. Some manufacturers make their contact information all but impossible to find.</h3>

<h3>Another fact to be aware of: sometimes a trip to the grocery store can be fraught with perils, although most people are never warned of this. My mother and I were shopping at a major grocery store; we had all of our items on the counter, when a bag of flour from the order ahead of us broke. My mother watched as the cashier pulled all of our items through the flour, despite our warnings to her about my mother's condition. Be aware of your surroundings. We really can't be expected to watch every event at the same time but, unfortunately, we sometimes have to make the attempt.</h3>

<h3>Gluten is a common and, in many countries, unlabeled ingredient in the human diet. Further complicating adherence, gluten-free products are not widely available and are more expensive than their gluten-containing counterparts. In addition, sticking perfectly over years to any diet for medical purposes is notoriously challenging. For such reasons, diet therapy is an incomplete solution."</h3>
    
<h3>This website does not try to assume that it has all the answers: In fact, the author fully realizes that there are more questions than answers, having lived with a family member with the disease for more than eight years. The author fully realizes the pitfalls and frustrations accompanying the disease, and hopes to provide clear information and personal experience to people who have recently been diagnosed.</h3>
