<h2>What is Celiac Disease?</h2>

<h3><b>Celiac Disease is an autoimmune disorder whereby the body develops an intolerance to Gluten, a protein found in Wheat, Barley, and Rye, many people with the disease also being unable to tolerate Oats.</b> When the human body develops an autoimmune disease, it attacks itself; in the case of Celiac Disease, the Villi, or tiny hairs lining the wall of the small intestine, become damaged, and the body is no longer able to digest and absorb nutrients from food. This leads to symptoms of malabsorption and a host of other maladies such as Diarrhea, gas, and abdominal pain (see the box at left).</h3>

<h3>Unfortunately, many of these symptoms are indicative of a host of other major diseases, leading doctors to search for other causes long before they consider Celiac Disease. Thus many people spend years undergoing test after test and enduring discomfort before they are finally correctly diagnosed. It is estimated that the average person waits 11 years before diagnosis (check facts and include reference on reference page).</h3>

<h2>What Causes Celiac Disease?</h2>

<h3>It is estimated that 37% of the population of the United States carries the Celiac Disease gene. However, some may never develop the disease unless they experience a traumatic event, such as an automobile accident, divorce, or even giving birth. Others, as mentioned above, may have already been displaying the symptoms for years, quietly suffering while waiting for a correct diagnosis.</h3>

<h3>Popular television has even begun to recognize the existence of Celiac Disease, and is incorporating in dramatic series: A couple of years ago, the series House broadcast an episode where Doctor House and his team spent the entire episode putting the patient through test after test- only near the end did it occur to Doctor House that the patient had Celiac Disease, a true-to-life scenario, regardless of how questionable the realism of the rest of the series seems.</h3>

<h2>The Gluten-Free Diet</h2>

<h3>Many books joyfully proclaim that, while Celiac Disease has no cure, going on a gluten-free diet will ease the symptoms and lead to a happy, relatively normal life of bliss. A search of different gluten-free discussion web sites, however, shows otherwise, with people citing personal experiences involving strange symptoms, foods that cannot be tolerated, and cruel family members. These issues are addressed on the Diet and Personal Issues pages.</h3>

<h3>The August 2009 issue of the journal Scientific American contains an article on Celiac Disease by Alessio Fasano, professor of pediatrics, medicine and physiology and director of the Mucosal Biology research center and the center for celiac research at the University of Maryland school of Medicine. At one point, the article states: "Regrettably, a lifelong adherence to a strict gluten-free diet is not easy." For more information on the Gluten-Free diet, including ways to be proactive, see the <a href="#">Diet Page.</a></h3>
